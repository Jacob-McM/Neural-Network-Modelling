# Modeling A Neural Network to Predict Charity Success 

This repo contains a demonstration of Neural Network modeling utilizing TensorFlow and Keras modeling tools. In this repo you will find:

|Notebook| Description|
|--------|------------|
|[alphabetsoup_model.ipynb](alphabetsoup_model.ipynb)| This notebook contains the initial attempt at modeling charity data to predict if a charity would be successful if provided funding|
|[AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimzation.ipynb.](AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimzation.ipynb.)| This notebook aims to optimize the model in order to achieve at least 75% accuracy|

A detailed breakdown of this project can be read in the [report markdown file](report.md) found in this repo.
